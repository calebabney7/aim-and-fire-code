# aim-and-fire-code
The code provided is for a 2D game that I created with a group of piers. The project was a 2D platformer. All the code is my own based on research I did for the project. The code allows for the movement of the player object and allows the player to aim a object that fires a projectile. The object follows the position of the mouse, but it is at a fixed distance from the playerâ€™s body. When the left mouse button is clicked, the projectile fires and moves for a set amount of time in a straight line. If it hits an object, it creates a joint that allows the player to swing around the point the projectile hits. Upon clicking the right mouse button, the joint is destroyed allowing the player to move freely again.
